# Food-App
App designed to help users decide on where to eat!

# Current Functionality
- uses current location to find a random, highly-rated restaurant nearby
- displays distance away, name, rating on yelp, images

# TODO:
- manual search (by category, etc?)
- UI upgrades/fixes
- link indexing (https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing)
- performance tweaking
- fixing the strings (lots of non-res defined strings)
